  <h1>Travel Suggestions</h1>

  <!-- 
    The form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form
    must be put inside.
    The attributes that are required are name, id, and method.

    name gives some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.
    
    id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our
    code.

    method has two typical values: get and post. Get is used for forms that do
    not ask for personal information (search bars, etc.). Post is used for forms
    that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.).
  -->
  <form name="travel-suggestions" id="travel" method="get">

    <!-- 
      This is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all required attributes.
      The required attribute is only necessary when you want to make sure the user
      has to fill in the input before submitting the form.

      The type attribute defines the type of input.
      The name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the
      input when the data gets passed to the server (requires back-end scripting,
      which is beyond the scope of this course).
      The id attribute allows us to reference the input from the label and from
      other parts of our code.

      All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the
      input using the input's id attribute.
      When an input is required, it is important to include the word required
      in the label's text.
    -->
    <label for="travel-location">Please Enter the City or Country You Suggest I Travel to [required]:</label>
    <input type="text" name="destination" id="travel-location" required />
    <br />
    <br />
    <label for="number-days">For how many days would you recommend I stay in this location? [required]</label>
    <input type="number" name="travelDays" id="number-days" maxlength="2" required />
    <br />
    <br />

    <!-- 
      A fieldset is an area in your form where you put inputs that are more related to each other
      than they are related to other inputs in the form (i.e., a list of travel items is more
      related to each other than the country the person is recommending).

      form is an important attribute to link the fieldset to the form it is related to.
    -->
    <fieldset form="travel">
      <!-- 
        A legend describes how the inputs inside the fieldset are all related.
      -->
      <legend>What travel items would you recommend I bring on the trip?</legend>

      <!-- 
        This is a checkbox input. Note, this is an input where the input typically comes
        before the label.

        type="checkbox", name, and id are all required. The value attribute is also required 
        and provides its value to the server if the user checks that box and submits the form.
        In this case, what would be passed to the server is waterBottle=bottle.
      -->
      <input type="checkbox" name="waterBottle" id="bottle" value="bottle" />
      <label for="bottle">Refillable Water Bottle</label>
      <br />

      <input type="checkbox" name="hat" id="travel-hat" value="hat" />
      <label for="travel-hat">A Hat</label>

      <input type="checkbox" name="backpack" id="backpack" value="pack" />
      <label for="backpack">A Backpack</label>

      <!-- 
        This is a radio button input, which are good when you want the user
        to select one option from a list of options.

        name, id, and value are all required attributes. The value should represent
        the choice the user has selected. Note, most importantly, the name attribute
        for each related radio button should be exactly the same.

        This is also an input where the label typically shows up after the input.

      This is a select input, which is essentially a dropdown input.

      name and id are the required attributes for a select input.

      Select inputs are widely used, but can lead to accessibility issues.
      If you can accomplish the same thing you want to do with a different
      type of input (i.e., radio buttons, text-based, etc.), you should use
      the other method of getting this information.

    <select name="countrySelect" id="country" required> -->

        optgroups let you group the options inside your select input.

      for a form.

      name and id are required attributes.
      Highly recommended attributes are rows and cols. rows defines the number of lines a
      user can type before a scrollbar appears. cols defines the number of characters across
      a user can type before their input goes to thwe next line.
