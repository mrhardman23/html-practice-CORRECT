  <!-- 
    The form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form
    must be put inside.
    The attributes that are required are name, id, and method.
    name gives some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.
    id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our
    code.
    method has two typical values: get and post. Get is used for forms that do
    not ask for personal information (search bars, etc.). Post is used for forms
    that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.).
  -->
  <form name="travel-suggestions" id="travel" method="get">

    <!-- 
      This is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all required attributes.
      The required attribute is only necessary when you want to make sure the user
      has to fill in the input before submitting the form.
      All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the
      input using the input's id attribute.
      When an input is required, it is important to include the word required
      in the label's text.
    -->
    <label for="travel-location">Please Enter the City or Country You Suggest I Travel to [required]:</label>
    <input type="text" name="destination" id="travel-location" required />

    <!-- 
      This is a password input. type="password", name, and id are all required 
      attributes.
      As always, each input needs a label with the for attribute to link the label
      to an input.
    -->
    <!-- <label for="password">Please Enter Your Password:</label>
    <input type="password" name="userPassword" id="password" /> -->
