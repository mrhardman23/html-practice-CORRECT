  <!-- 
    This is an example of an image tag. 
    The src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
    The src attribute can be an Internet location (i.e., https://www.google.com/...),
    but the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the
    images you use on your website.

    NOTE: img is a self-closing tag.
